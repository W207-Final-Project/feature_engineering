    "### Predicting altruism through free pizza\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is originated from the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza. We will create an algorithm to predict which requests will recieve pizza and which on will not.  The competition contains a dataset with 5671 textual requests for pizza from the Reddit community Random Acts of Pizza together with their outcome (successful/unsuccessful) and meta-data. This data was collected and graciously shared by Althoff et al (http://www.timalthoff.com/). \n",

We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. \n",

My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)\n",
